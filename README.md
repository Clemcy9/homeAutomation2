# homeAutomation2
using a local network to creat iot where various gadget could be interfaced and controlled from a local web server
# This version of homeAutomation focuses more on the usability and functionality of the webserver. 
The whole web interface is designed from scratch(html, css, and javaScript), without the use of helper and third party plugin like bootstrap.
This promises to be nice, Let's do it!
